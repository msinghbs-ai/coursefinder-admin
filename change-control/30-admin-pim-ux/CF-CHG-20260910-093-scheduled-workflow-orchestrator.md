# CF-CHG-20260910-093 — Scheduled Workflow Orchestrator

**Status:** OPEN / DESIGN-TO-IMPLEMENTATION  
**Initiated:** 2026-09-10 21:44 AEST  
**Origin:** Scheduled Tasks operator UX review  
**Owner:** CourseFinder programme  
**Primary category:** 30-admin-pim-ux  
**Related categories:** 20-layer1-regulatory-ingestion, 40-layer2-enrichment, 80-uat-release-operations

## Problem

The accepted v2.15.76 Scheduled Tasks surface exposes bounded policies using raw source/profile UUID targets. Operators cannot reliably determine which dataset or business workflow a schedule represents, and on-demand execution can only replay an existing bounded policy rather than present a task-first target builder.

## Requested outcome

Add one governed task-first workflow-orchestration experience that can be reused across Layer 1 authoritative/statistical ingestion, Layer 2 deterministic enrichment, conditional Layer 3 Evidence interpretation and Layer 4 exception routing without weakening layer authority boundaries.

The operator model is:

`Job / Dataset -> Country -> Scope -> Target -> Processing mode -> Run now or Schedule`

Human-readable business labels must be primary. Technical policy/source/profile IDs remain available only under progressive-disclosure technical details.

## Initial governed workflow catalogue

- Layer 1 regulatory/reference: AU CRICOS, NZQA, QILT, PRISMS, QS, THE and future qualified ranking/reference datasets.
- Layer 2 deterministic enrichment: Course facts/URLs/fees/intakes/requirements, Scholarships, Provider Assets and supporting Evidence acquisition.
- Combined L2 -> conditional L3: Course fields requiring Evidence interpretation, Provider international contacts and other profile-qualified interpretation work.
- L2 -> conditional L3 -> L4 exceptions: ambiguous contacts, eligibility/scope or other unresolved governed interpretations.
- L1 -> conditional L4: ambiguous Provider mapping for publisher ranking/reference datasets.
- Search/Publication remain downstream consequences and are not ingestion stages.

## Authority / safety rules

1. Layer 1 identity/authority cannot be redefined by L2/L3/L4 shortcuts.
2. Layer 3 may run only against governed Evidence/profile/model/revalidation contracts.
3. Layer 4 is exception/human resolution and must preserve source/Evidence/history.
4. Scholarship Provider ownership alone must not manufacture Course eligibility.
5. On-demand execution must not silently alter recurring cadence/next-run state.
6. Browser reads/writes remain through governed RPC/control surfaces; no service-role or provider secrets are exposed.
7. Existing v2.15.76 CF-092 scheduler acceptance remains the baseline; changes extend rather than bypass its policy/audit/idempotency semantics.

## Acceptance target

- task-first human-readable Scheduled Tasks UI;
- universal scope/target builder using only server-authorised options;
- explicit processing modes: automatic governed pipeline, acquisition only, reprocess governed Evidence where eligible;
- run preview before consequential dispatch;
- durable operator reason/audit;
- direct follow-through to resulting Job and Evidence;
- scheduler/history tables show business workflow labels, scope and latest result rather than raw UUIDs;
- UUIDs available under Technical details;
- negative/rank/browser security paths preserved;
- targeted contract/build/UAT then nominated deployed acceptance;
- visible release/version and CHANGELOG updated for browser-facing behaviour;
- RUNSHEET/CURRENT-STATE/FOLLOW-UPS/NEXT-CHAT reconciled before closure.

## Implementation note

Implementation must first inventory currently executable runtime source/profile/policy contracts. Do not expose a workflow option merely because a future design exists. Unsupported country/state/provider granularity must be disabled or clearly marked unavailable rather than simulated client-side.
