# CourseFinder Change Control Register

**Status:** AUTHORITATIVE INDEX  
**Effective:** 21 August 2026

This file indexes material CourseFinder changes. Detailed records live in category folders under `/change-control/`.

> **M1-PIM-FINALISATION final state:** the shared Admin/PIM browser gate for controls `001`, `005`–`015` is **CLOSED / PASS**. The deployment-source/legacy-RPC incident was resolved without ACL rollback, fresh real-browser telemetry uses governed `/rpc/admin_read` with HTTP 200, PIM Admin v2.11 is deployed from the actual `Coursefinder-Pilot` source, and the operator explicitly accepted the visual/interaction release at **20 August 2026 22:42 AEST**.
>
> **M1-PIPELINE-OPS handoff:** governance ambiguity is resolved under `CF-CHG-20260821-016`. `CF-CHG-20260820-013` remains CLOSED / PASS for its original role-boundary/safe-Sources scope; residual Pipeline-specific rank-4 browser/action acceptance is explicitly carried forward by `016` rather than reopening the accepted PIM gate.
