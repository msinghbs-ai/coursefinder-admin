# Weekend Integration Controller and AI continuity — execution record

Authority: Platform Admin mandate received 6 November 2026 in the current authorised Codex execution. Scope: 7–8 November engineering and a Monday 9 November handover, with permanent vendor-independent continuity. Tracking: [Admin #382](https://github.com/msinghbs-ai/coursefinder-admin/issues/382). Execution: `codex-weekend-20261106-0903Z`. All stored times UTC; display timezone Australia/Melbourne.

## Decision before implementation

The current mandate supersedes the 5 November Claude-only staffing allocation for this assignment. It does not supersede release-specific approval gates, G3, spending reserves, human admission, destructive-change restrictions or the holds on Pilot #890 and #875.

Extend the canonical `docs/platform/STUDYSEARCH-EXECUTION-REGISTER.md`, `AGENT-OPERATING-MODEL.md` and `nz-enrichment-brief/INDEX.md`. The register will contain the concise current handover; a versioned JSON checkpoint and schema will live beside it. Do not create a second issue queue: `pipeline.integration_issues` is the live operational queue. Existing September milestone documents are historical and the active router's three m2.4.7 continuity files are empty; this does not justify reviving stale September state.

Implement a GitHub ref coordination protocol: one-parent commits, server-enforced fast-forward-only updates, expected-head checks, no force updates, pinned immutable operation identifiers, and fail-closed ownership verification. A lease expiry never permits takeover without reconciliation of running/queued workflows, direct writes and predecessor status. Start in reconciliation; no existing exclusive controller lock has been found. Git documents without the atomic ref transition are not ownership authority. Do not describe the mechanism as production-enforced until every production entry point participates.

The prior controller is recorded as Claude; acknowledgement/release is not available in this execution. Current candidate: Codex in the managed cloud environment. No production writes or releases while ownership remains uncertain. Independent read-only engineering and continuity work can continue.

## Reconciliation so far

- Admin main `006e0eafc1259470480a373e9991cdeba7fd1e67`; Pilot main `4ba94e3fcde53c11528eb2bfc1b5e9bc0dec2067`.
- Live database read at 2026-11-06T09:07:34Z: applied migration head `20261106400000`; provider-description migration `20261106200000` is present. Database schema order differs from merge order; use applied versions, never infer from filename alone.
- Live deploy check 27 records v2.15.489, OK at 02:22:35Z. This is historical database evidence; fresh Worker version verification is still pending.
- No in-progress GitHub workflow observed at 09:09Z. One queued historical CF-093 UQ dispatcher run `34749286102` requires investigation; do not cancel or replay it blindly.
- No other active database transaction observed at 09:09Z. This is an observation, not proof that a predecessor cannot initiate another write.
- Live Mode 1 remains active. Provider descriptions: 5 reads (4 proposed, 1 held), no active read lease; bounded workflow acceptance still pending.
- Course-description Layer 4 pending count is now 1,030; earlier 857 in the register is stale.
- Source and vendor holds remain. Course search reports out_of_toolset; no spending override authorised.

## Owned independent reviews

WS-894: existing isolated branch `cf247-course-descriptions-complete`, head `162e9fc78a6b760c6f0db94df340773903518c92`; independent reviewer `review_894`; no file ownership or mutation. Acceptance: exact-head checks, migration and admission review, actionable release blockers.

WS-893-892: existing isolated branches `cf247-english-requirements-complete` and `cf247-test-evidence`; independent reviewer `review_893_892`; no overlapping implementation writes. Acceptance: exact-head CI, root cause of failed evidence and dependencies.

Confirmed #894 blockers: two re-asks permitted against D4's one; final-page Previous hidden; publication count lacks publication predicate; fixture pipelines mask execution failures. Confirmed #893 blocker: successful workflow log contains fixture and missing-relation SQL errors hidden by tee. #892 correctly records a full-suite phone failure owned by #894. These are not production fixes and no operational issue has been closed.

## Execution boundary

No production mutation, migration, deployment, vendor read, admission or publication initiated by this execution. Shell proxy cannot connect; GitHub and Supabase connectors provide read access. Do not fabricate an unattended weekend execution, heartbeats, future results, Monday report or successor acceptance. Schedule actual resumptions where supported, and publish their verified outcomes only after they run.

Next safe action: implement and validate the continuity extension, publish the findings, and resolve ownership adoption through GitHub without using the Platform Admin as an AI message relay.
