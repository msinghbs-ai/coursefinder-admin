## Entry reconciliation finding — legacy Layer 1 stale job recovery

Runtime inventory found one genuine stale legacy `pipeline.jobs` row:
- job `da22a5cf-9bff-4597-9193-9503aaad075c`;
- domain `regulatory`;
- job type `regulatory_sync`;
- state had remained `running` since 17 August 2026;
- all active cron schedulers were otherwise reporting successful latest executions.

Root cause:
- accepted Layer 1 housekeeping cleaned expired terminal `layer1_run_queue` rows only;
- Layer 2 already recovered stale `pipeline.jobs` rows for `layer2%`;
- Layer 3 already recovered stale reserved/calling interpretations;
- no equivalent bounded recovery existed for legacy Layer 1 `regulatory_sync` jobs.

Corrective Pilot source:
`29cffeb1ad3824f7569d4b597e0103e3c880bb8a`.

Migration:
`20260830021400_m2_4_4_layer1_legacy_stale_job_recovery`.

Deployed validation:
- candidate query matched exactly 1 stale legacy regulatory job;
- housekeeping execution recovered exactly 1;
- remaining stale legacy regulatory running jobs: 0;
- governed Evidence deleted: 0;
- source versions deleted: 0;
- canonical history deleted: 0;
- Security Advisor remains 135 INFO / 0 WARN / 0 ERROR;
- Performance Advisor remains 169 INFO / 0 WARN / 0 ERROR.

The recovery excludes any job still owned by a live `layer1_run_queue` heartbeat.
